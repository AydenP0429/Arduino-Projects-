This Was My first Ever Arduino Project in which I created a ultrasonic scanner that detects objects and beeps when it detects

Need:
Arduino board (Uno, Nano, etc.)
Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04 is common)
Servo motor
Jumper wires
buzzer

I placed my Ultrasonic scanner on top of the servo motor so it can detect within a 180 dgrees radius 

Have Fun!
