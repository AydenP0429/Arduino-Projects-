This was my first ever Adruino project where I attache an ultrasonic scanner to a servo moter to imitate a radar
I attached a buzzer so everytime something is detected it will beep 

Needs:
Arduino board (Uno, Nano, etc.)
Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04 is common)
Servo motor
Jumper wires

Have Fun!

A servo motor might take time to calibrate 
If servo motor stops then re-run the code
